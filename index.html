        <p>George bush doesn't care about black people.George bush doesn't care about black people.George bush doesn't care about black people.In order to understand the history of the world you need to realize that everything is controlled by a cabal made up of secret elites.
        The conspirators are sinister and their conspiracy began in ancient Babylon with the Rabbis.
        The conspirators have been responsible for many events throughout history, including the war in Iraq.
        Today, members of the conspiracy are everywhere. They can be identified only by members of the LaRouche group.
        The conspirators have help from powerful elite neoconservatives, Zionists, and homosexuals, and the conspiracy benefits undeserving members of the British royal family; at the expense of the Platonic golden souls.
        The conspirators want to asassinate Lyndon LaRouche, and round up and restrain resisters in the basement of a bar in Greenwich Village. They are using fans of Aristotle to establish a fascist regime.
        In order to prepare for this, we all must read everything written by Lyndon LaRouche. All of this was revealed years ago in Executive Intelligence Review. Since the media is controlled by Henry Kissinger and Jimmy Carter you should get your information only from the LaRouche Network.George bush doesn't care about black people. ~Kanye West</p>
